# Full Stack Blockchain

### NOTE: Project still under development (WIP)
Explanation **(WIP)**: Full-Stack Application of Blockchain and paired cryptocurrency, implemented almost entirely from scratch using Javascript and cryptographic Javascript libraries 

  * ***Purpose:***
	> Build a traditional, proof-of-work Blockchain with supported cryptocurrency for secure, peer-to-peer transactions, entirely from scratch using Javascript
	
	> While the asset (and its correposnding digital twin) has yet to be determined *(as of 1/12/2020)*, this project is to demonstrate the utility of a 
	traditional blockchain in ensuring transactional security & authenticity of data while optimizing business logic, based entirely on first principles 

  * **Utility:**
	Technical
	1. Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability of transactional data at rest & in motion
	
	2. Nonrepudiation due to time-stamped, hash-linked blocks of data, leading to an irrefutable transactional record

  * **Design:**
	1. ***(COMPLETED 1/11/2020)*** Proof-Of-Work (PoW) Consensus Algorithm 
	
	2. ***(COMPLETED 1/13/2020)*** REST APIs for Blockchain instances to communicate with each other
	
	3. ***(COMPLETED 1/14/2020)*** PubSub protocol for asynchronous communication 

	4. ***(COMPLETED 1/31/2020)*** Cryptocurrency and linked wallet functionality

	5. React Blockchain Explorer FrontEnd 
  
  * **Technologies:**
	1. NodeJS
	
	2. React (v16.6.0, save flag)
	
	3. Heroku
